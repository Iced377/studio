## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Enable secure login/sign-up using Firebase Authentication (Google, email/password, optional Apple).
- Food Logging Interface: Mimic MyFitnessPal-style interface with meal categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks), manual entry, barcode scanning, and search by food name.
- FODMAP Detection AI: Use AI tool to analyze entered food items and calculate FODMAP score per ingredient, then display a traffic light risk indicator (Green = safe, Yellow = moderate, Red = high risk), with the reason.
- User-Specific Safety Benchmarking: Let users tag any food item as “Safe for me,” store FODMAP profile of that item as a personal benchmark, and use this benchmark to provide relative safety assessments for new foods, with "Similar to Safe Foods" badge.
